Simple puzzle game to demonstrate use of React Native

As a web developer I am used to frameworks like Angular, but I am learning both React and React Native and publishing the results of some of my experiments here

## Aim

To demonstrate the use of features like React Native animation that are not well documented as yet. To abuse React Native as a framework to create games!

## Acknowledgements

I am endebted to Colin Eberhardt for his [excellent React Native tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript) over on [Ray Wenderlich's blog](http://www.raywenderlich.com).

I am using [react-native-viewport](https://github.com/pjjanak/react-native-viewport) to help my app adjust for different devices.
